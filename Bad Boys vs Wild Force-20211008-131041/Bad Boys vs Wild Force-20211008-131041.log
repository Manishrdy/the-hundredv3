The new bowler is Dale

Ball 32 - Dale to L Modi, One Run, L Modi fails to clip the ball away and the ball goes off the pads for a single
Ball 33 - Dale to C Swift, dot, all throw their heads back in disappointment. Was the slider outside off stump, C Swift stayed back to late cut, missed
Ball 34 - Dale to C Swift, dot, bowler tests him with a fuller ball close to off, C Swift not falling in the trap. Lifts the bat high
Ball 35 - Dale to C Swift, dot, oes get the on-drive out to a decent extent but mid-on is very straight as they wanted C Swift to play more across the line. Cut off with a dive
Ball 36 - Dale to C Swift, dot, top leave! A step across the stumps to counter movement, this one did jag back in off the seam off a fullish length but C Swift had it covered
Ball 37 - Dale to C Swift, One Run, angling in, C Swift clips the ball away into the on-side for a single as that was on the pads. He is finally ticking the scoreboard over
Ball 38 - Dale to L Modi, SIX !, hey hey hey! This is audacious stuff. This is a world class bowler who is known for yorkers and you just can't put your front foot across and play a sweep shot over backward square leg.
Ball 39 - Dale to L Modi, dot, well bowled, well played. Got a stride forward to cover the line of this full ball and then offered no shot
Ball 40 - Dale to L Modi, Leg Bye

Ball 49 - M Ali to C Swift, FOUR runs, that was a poor shot! Poky outside off, hung his bat outside off and the ball went off the edge. The slip fielder at fourth slip dived to his left but was away. That gap between second and fourth slip didn't help

Ball 64 - AK to L Modi, FOUR runs, crowd getting right behind the bowler as he runs in and L Modi brings out an authoritative pull shot to a 93mph ball to make a strong statement. It's a theatre out there! Gee, that raced off the bat

Ball 71 - Dale to L Modi, Two Runs, good length delivery shaping back in, L Modi works it behind square and comes back for the second too

Ball 73 - Dale to L Modi, One Run, begins with a loopy overcook, L Modi drilled through the covers
Ball 74 - Dale to C Swift, FOUR runs, that was a poor shot! Poky outside off, hung his bat outside off and the ball went off the edge. The slip fielder at fourth slip dived to his left but was away. That gap between second and fourth slip didn't help

Ball 86 - X Factor to C Swift, dot, good length outside off stump, lets it go
