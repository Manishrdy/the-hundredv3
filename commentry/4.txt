short and pleading to be bashed!
frustraing inside edge rolls past the stumps. 94mph short of length delivery, batsman rushed on the back foot defence. The edge escapes the sticks and runs away to the fine leg boundary
crowd getting right behind the bowler as he runs in and batsman brings out an authoritative pull shot to a 93mph ball to make a strong statement. It's a theatre out there! Gee, that raced off the bat
down the track and lofting. We have seen him hole out to deep mid-on in Tests attempting this shot, but this time he got close to the pitch of the ball and nailed the shot. Now Root has pushed the man back to the long-on boundary
softens the bottom hand when the ball made impact and drives the ball away into the covers for a couple of runs. Was a fuller ball, batsman went back and across to send it into the off-side
punches the ball on the up and square of the wicket for a four. That was on a length and batsman drove it through the off-side for a four
loose shot! The bowler bowls it fuller outside off, batsman throws his bat at it and gets it flying through the cordon for a four. Only two slips and a gully won't bargain many wickets
that was a poor shot! Poky outside off, hung his bat outside off and the ball went off the edge. The slip fielder at fourth slip dived to his left but was away. That gap between second and fourth slip didn't help
superb shot! That's the class of batsman.
oh shot! Look at that pose, look at that high elbow and look at that balance. Full and juicy outside off stump, batsman creams the cover drive
short and wayward down leg. No chance for keeper and he'll be livid that this will counted as byes. No way a human could have stopped that
would you believe this? Bloke has played a text book front foot lofted cover drive in the final over of a T20 game when people usually lose shape looking swing hard.
