this is a gigantic blow!
Waltzes down the wicket, meets the ball on a length and swats the bowler into the wide long-on stands. Clean as a whistle
batsman dances down and slams that over long-off for a sixer. Beautiful use of the feet, got to the pitch of the ball and slammed it big. The batsman has finally broken the shackles
hey hey hey! This is audacious stuff. This is a world class bowler who is known for yorkers and you just can't put your front foot across and play a sweep shot over backward square leg.
big full toss. Oh thank you very much. batsman swings across the line, doesn't find the middle of the bat but he doesn't care.
