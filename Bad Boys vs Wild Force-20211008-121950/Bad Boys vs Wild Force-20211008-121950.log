The new batsman is I Gunda
The new batsman is TSP
The new bowler is F Jaacob

Ball 1 - F Jaacob to I Gunda, FOUR runs, short and wayward down leg. No chance for keeper and he'll be livid that this will counted as byes. No way a human could have stopped that
Ball 2 - F Jaacob to I Gunda, dot, top leave! A step across the stumps to counter movement, this one did jag back in off the seam off a fullish length but I Gunda had it covered
Ball 3 - F Jaacob to I Gunda, FOUR runs, oh shot! Look at that pose, look at that high elbow and look at that balance. Full and juicy outside off stump, I Gunda creams the cover drive
Ball 4 - F Jaacob to I Gunda, FOUR runs, oh shot! Look at that pose, look at that high elbow and look at that balance. Full and juicy outside off stump, I Gunda creams the cover drive
Ball 5 - F Jaacob to I Gunda, dot, I Gunda was completely deceived 
Ball 6 - F Jaacob to I Gunda, SIX !, big full toss. Oh thank you very much. I Gunda swings across the line, doesn't find the middle of the bat but he doesn't care.
Ball 7 - F Jaacob to I Gunda, One Run, flighted delivery on the stumps, I Gunda drives it to mid-on
Ball 8 - F Jaacob to TSP, dot, inside edge rolls to leg. The extra ball scares TSP just a bit by moving back in off the seam
Ball 9 - F Jaacob to TSP, Two Runs, good length delivery shaping back in, TSP works it behind square and comes back for the second too
Ball 10 - F Jaacob to TSP, dot, not enough time to fully come forward and defend. Played from the crease

     End of 10 balls - 21 runs
     Wild Force     21-0
     RR - 2.1

Ball 18 - RUDI S to TSP, FOUR runs, that was a poor shot! Poky outside off, hung his bat outside off and the ball went off the edge. The slip fielder at fourth slip dived to his left but was away. That gap between second and fourth slip didn't help
Ball 19 - RUDI S to TSP, dot, fullish and outside off stump, TSP lets it go
Ball 20 - RUDI S to TSP, dot, all throw their heads back in disappointment. Was the slider outside off stump, TSP stayed back to late cut, missed
